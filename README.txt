INSTRUCTIONS

This program needs the web browser "Google Chrome" to be executed.

Use the class "Home" to launch the program. Once you launched it, it will open a window with two options:
1. a drop down menu with the list of the emperors;
2. a textfield where you can search any person of the roman's dinasty.

After the selection, the program needs a few minutes, based of the dimension of the dinasty, 
to create an image of the dinasty tree. 
On the top left of the image there is an info botton that can be use to see the history search
or to save the current image.

If you want to search another dinasty you can use the two options described above otherwise
if you want to quit click the botton "X" on the top right of the window and click on "Yes".
